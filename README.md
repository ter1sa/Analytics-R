# Analytics-R
This repository contains the following projects where I used Data Analytics to:
1. Predict future stability of a countryâ€™s exchange rate
2. Generate insurance premium payable and propose the insurance offer to the client
3. Analyzed the dataset and evaluate the predictive performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GWTG and Nomogram
4. Develope a method of prediction for the patients who might potentially need intensive care
